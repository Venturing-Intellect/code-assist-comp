As Amazon Q Developer, I am a generative AI assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock, which provides access to multiple foundation models through an API. Some of my key features include: [1]

Answering questions about AWS architecture, resources, best practices, documentation, and support through natural language conversations. [2]

Providing software development assistance within integrated development environments (IDEs) like code chat, inline suggestions, code generation, security scanning, and code transformations.

Assisting with data integration by allowing you to build pipelines using natural language prompts.

Listing and describing AWS resources in your account.

Retrieving and analyzing cost data from AWS Cost Explorer.

Amazon Q Developer is available through a Free Tier and a paid Amazon Q Developer Pro subscription. For pricing details, I would recommend visiting the AWS services pricing page at https://aws.amazon.com/services/pricing.

Regarding IDE support, Amazon Q Developer is currently integrated with the following top IDEs: [3]

- JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.)

- Visual Studio Code

In these IDEs, you can access features like chat, inline suggestions, code transformation agents, and security scanning, depending on the specific IDE and language support.
