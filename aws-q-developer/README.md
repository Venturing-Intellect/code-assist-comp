# Amazon Q Developer

Goal of the codewhisperer AI is to write the [AI Comparison Tool](https://github.com/Venturing-Intellect/code-assist-comp/wiki/Software-project-for-comparison) without any human intervention so it can be used with different other tools.

The information of human information will be marked as **Human Intervention**.

Developer is responsible for logging the prompts and responses in the `docs/` folder.

## Analysis

Through the analysis it's important to understand the following questions:

1. General info like features, LLM model support and pricing
2. IDE support: IntelliJ and VS Code
3. Writing and understanding basic algorithms (creating a regex pattern for email validation)
4. Debugging simple code errors (resolving logic issues in conditional statements)
5. Generating boilerplate code (setting up an API endpoint)
6. Learning new programming concepts (implementing recursion)
7. Creating small projects (generating a reply for a client email using an LLM web service)
8. Writing and running unit tests (generating unit tests for existing code)
9. Optimizing code for better performance (fixing n+1 SQL query problem in an existing code base)
10. Implementing advanced programming concepts (converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one)

## General info & IDE Support

You can check that in the [General prompts via Amazon Q](../docs/amazon-q.md##general-information-prompt).
